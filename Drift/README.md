# Drift
Makes WoW frames movable

## TODO
1. Make frames from Addons movable (only works on preloaded frames currently)
1. Make frames keep old positions across logins (saved variables)
1. Configuration options (like reset positions or disable opacity change)
1. Add support for more frame types like containers or unit frames
1. Make it work for world map and any other frames missing
1. Disable limit of 2 frames if possible
